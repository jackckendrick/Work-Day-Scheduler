# Work-Day-Scheduler
This repository contains the code for an hourly work planner. 

The work-day-scheduler is to be used as a daily planner to create an hourly schedule. When the planner is opened, the day is displayed at the top of the calendar. Upon scrolling down, the user is presented with hourly time-blocks. Each hour is color-coded indicating whether it is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicking into a time-bllock, they can type their tasks and save them in the local storage by clicking the save button. When the page is refreshed, the the task will still appear in the corresponding time-block. 

The deployed webpage should resemble the following animation: <link href="./assets/worday-scheduler.gif"/>
